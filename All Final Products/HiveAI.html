    <h1>What is Hive?</h1>
    <p>You have to bee kidding me! How do you not know what Hive is? Hive is a bee type of simulator game where you <strong>program your bot</strong> to try and win by collecting pollen, returning it to base, stealing from others or do other various tasks that you can think of and create. Some people chose to even have their bees do other various tasks to try to help them win. Others made their bots look at other bot's position to then figure out how far away they are and then run away or go towards them so they could either steal or run from their opponets to win. </p>

    <h1>What did my Bee do?</h1>
    <p>I decided that I wanted my bot to do 4 basic tasks. These tasks were : <strong>Collect pollen, return to base, Chase down opponets that had a lot of pollen, and Steal pollen from Bases. </strong> I chose these tasks because they were simple but very effective and allowed me to get up to <strong>8th place</strong> on the leaderboard. I was able to limit how much of a task I wanted to make occur more often by using math so that my bot wouldn't chase more than collect or collect more than returning to base. Using this method of <strong>trial by error</strong> then editing my code changing the math or adding a task allowed me to get very far up on the leaderboard and helped me win a couple games.</p>
